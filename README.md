## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla js

### What I learned

One of the major things i leearned in this project is out to use the eval() function in javascript and i also improved my knowledge on using javascript local storage.

code i am proud of:

```html
<div class="toggle" id="theme-1">
  <i class="indicator"></i>
</div>
<div id="screen" class="screen">0</div>
```

```css
.item:nth-of-type(17) {
  grid-column: 1/3;
}
.item:nth-of-type(18) {
  grid-column: 3/5;
}
```

```js
const updateTheme = () => {
  const themeGetter = localStorage.getItem('theme');
  const themeMain = JSON.parse(themeGetter);
  html.classList = themeMain;
  toggle.id = themeMain;
};
```
